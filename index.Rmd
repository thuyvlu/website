I am a PhD candidate in the Department of Statistics at the University of California, Irvine. I specialize in interrupted time series, correlated data, and non-random sampling designs. I have collaborative experience designing, conducting, and analyzing randomized and observational studies in Alzheimer's disease and dementia research, with focus on recruitment and assessment strategies.

I am actively seeking to transition into a Statistician or Research Scientist role where I can apply my statistical expertise to address real-world challenges in drug development, clinical trials, or health outcomes research.
